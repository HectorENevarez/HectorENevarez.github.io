A foundational piece to learning artificial intelligence is understanding the architecture of neural networks. Many are frightened by the "complexity" of this topic but in fact, neural networks aren't that complicated. This post aims to demystify neural networks by providing an intuitive and comprehensive tutorial on the inner workings of neural networks.

This post is intended for beginners with no previous experience in artificial intelligence but should also provide value to even those who already have a solid background in this field. We'll be going over the inner workings of neural networks as well as programming them from scratch in python.
