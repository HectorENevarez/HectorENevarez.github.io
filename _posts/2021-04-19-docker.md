# Include
## Background
## Prerequisites
All information for this tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa). Having this operating system is not a hard requirement but some information may be different on your personal machine. This information should be consistent for most linux distros but might differ on operating systems such as Mac or Windows.

There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial besides basic familiarity with the command line and text editor

Before we get started we need to make sure we install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods). Docker Engine is the main product of Docker which we will be using.

Once Docker Engine is installed, try running the following command:
```
me@mycomputer:~$ docker run hello-world
```
Like every other hello world program, this is used to make sure our installation is set up correctly. You should see your terminal display the following results:
```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

Once you are able to see this message, that means everything is set up correctly and we can go ahead and get started!

# Getting Started
With your newfound surface level understanding of what Docker is and a clean installation of Docker Engine, we are ready to get started. 

As mentioned before Docker is a way to package your software so it can run on any hardware. In order to achieve this, there are three main components you must understand.
- **Dockerfile** This is a text document that holds all the user commands required in assemble an image. We can think of this as our blueprint
- **Image** A Docker image is a template containing a set of instructions for creating a Docker container
- **Container** The Docker container is a running instance of an Image

Those three concepts are all we need to know to have a simple understanding of Docker. For this tutorial we will be creating our own dockerfile to generate an image and using docker run to start a container from the image we created. Our Docker container will run a simple python script that creates an array using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and prints it to the console.
