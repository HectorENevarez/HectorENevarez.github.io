**Hello!** My name is Hector and I am currently a third year student studying computer science at San Diego State University. I enjoy learning and I have found that the best way to learn something new is by teaching it. I apply this principle by giving [weekly workshops](https://hectorenevarez.github.io/workshops/) through [SDSU's AI Club](https://aiclub.sdsu.edu/). Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or a random interesting fact.
